\usage{
rpubsUpload(
  title,
  htmlFile,
  id = NULL,
  properties = list(),
  method = getOption("rpubs.upload.method", "auto")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{title}{The title of the document.}

\item{htmlFile}{The path to the HTML file to upload.}

\item{id}{If this upload is an update of an existing document then the id
parameter should specify the document id to update. Note that the id is
provided as an element of the list returned by successful calls to
\code{rpubsUpload}.}

\item{properties}{A named list containing additional document properties
(RPubs doesn't currently expect any additional properties, this parameter
is reserved for future use).}

\item{method}{Method to be used for uploading. "internal" uses a plain http
socket connection; "curl" uses the curl binary to do an https upload;
"rcurl" uses the RCurl package to do an https upload; and "auto" uses the
best available method searched for in the following order: "curl", "rcurl",
and then "internal". The global default behavior can be configured by
setting the \code{rpubs.upload.method} option (the default is "auto").}
}
\value{
A named list. If the upload was successful then the list contains a
  \code{id} element that can be used to subsequently update the document as
  well as a \code{continueUrl} element that provides a URL that a browser
  should be opened to in order to complete publishing of the document. If the
  upload fails then the list contains an \code{error} element which contains
  an explanation of the error that occurred.
}
\description{
This function uploads an HTML file to rpubs.com. If the upload succeeds a
list that includes an \code{id} and \code{continueUrl} is returned. A browser
should be opened to the \code{continueUrl} to complete publishing of the
document. If an error occurs then a diagnostic message is returned in the
\code{error} element of the list.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# upload a document
result <- rpubsUpload("My document title", "Document.html")
if (!is.null(result$continueUrl))
    browseURL(result$continueUrl) else stop(result$error)

# update the same document with a new title
updateResult <- rpubsUpload("My updated title", "Document.html", result$id)
}
}
