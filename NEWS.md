# CHANGES IN markdown VERSION 1.13

- Cleaned `sourcepos` records when they come from metadata (thanks, @dmurdoch, #111).

- The **markdown** package is in the maintenance-only mode now. It is feature-complete, and will receive no updates except for fixing CRAN problems. New development will continue only in **litedown**: <https://github.com/yihui/litedown>.

# CHANGES IN markdown VERSION 1.12

- Provided three internal functions `html_document`, `html_vignette`, and `pdf_document` as compatibility layers to functions of the same names in the **rmarkdown** package (thanks, @jangorecki, #108).

- The default HTML template no longer wraps meta variables `include-before` and `include-after` inside `<div></div>`, because their values may contain incomplete HTML tags, e.g., `include-before = '<div>'` and `include-after = '</div>'`.

# CHANGES IN markdown VERSION 1.11

- Verbatim code blocks of the form ```` ```{lang attr1 attr2 ...} ```` were not correctly rendered.

# CHANGES IN markdown VERSION 1.10

- Raw blocks (```` ```{=lang} ````) were broken in the previous version when the support for code block attributes was added.

# CHANGES IN markdown VERSION 1.9

- Added support for attributes on fenced code blocks, e.g., ```` ```{.lang .class2 #id attr="value"}```` (thanks, @thothal, #106).

- Fixed the bug that the option `number_sections: true` doesn't work for HTML output when then input contains certain Unicode characters (thanks, @fyuniv, #104).

- Added support for rendering HTML Widgets such as **ggplotly** (thanks, @fyuniv, #105).

# CHANGES IN markdown VERSION 1.8

- Fixed the superfluous warning about path lengths in `mark_html()` (thanks, @kenjisato, #103).

# CHANGES IN markdown VERSION 1.7

- The `file` argument of `mark()` will be treated as a file path only if the file exists and the value is not wrapped in `I()`. Previously, it would be treated as a file path when it has a file extension, which could lead to confusing errors like #100 (thanks, @LukasWallrich).

- When there are emojis in the text, `mark()` may fail to identify and embed web resources (thanks, @tdhock, yihui/knitr#2254).

# CHANGES IN markdown VERSION 1.6

- Added support for footnotes, fenced `Div`s, section numbers, `{}` attributes for images/headings/fenced `Div`s, and appendices. See `vignette('intro', package = 'markdown')` for details.

- A lot of enhancements to the HTML slides format. See `vignette('slides', package = 'markdown')` for details.

- Added `vignette('article', package = 'markdown')` to demonstrate how to write an HTML article.

- If the input to `mark()` is a file, the output will also be a file by default. Previously the output would be text. If you want `mark()` to return text output when the input is a file, you may specify the argument `output = NULL`.

- The Markdown option `base64_images` has been renamed to `embed_resources`. This option can take two possible values, `"local"` and `"https"`, meaning whether to embed local and/or web (https) resources. You can specify none, either, or both of them. See `vignette('intro', package = 'markdown')` for details.

- Removed the option `standalone` from the list of Markdown options. Please use the argument `template = TRUE/FALSE` of `mark()` instead. The option `standalone = TRUE` was equivalent to `template = TRUE`.

- Added the option `auto_identifiers` (enabled by default) to automatically add IDs to headings, e.g., `# Hello world!` will be converted to `<h1 id="hello-world">Hello world!</h1>`. You can certainly override the automatic ID by providing an ID manually via the `{#id}` attribute, e.g., `# Hello world! {#hello}`.

- Renamed the `mathjax` option to `js_math` to allow for other JS math libraries. The default library was changed from MathJax to KaTeX. To continue using MathJax, you may set `js_math: mathjax`.

- Removed the option `mathjax_embed` from the list of Markdown options. To embed the MathJax library, enable `"https"` in the `embed_resources` option instead. Note that only MathJax v3 can be partially embedded, and lower versions cannot.

- Renamed the option `highlight_code` to `js_highlight`, and added support for an alternative syntax highlighting JS library Prism.js, which became the default. To continue using the old default `highlight.js`, you may set the `js_highlight` option to `highlight`.

- The default version of MathJax has been changed from v2 to v3.

- The default version of highlight.js has been changed from 11.6.0 to 11.7.0, and the default style has been switched from `github` to `xcode`.

# CHANGES IN markdown VERSION 1.5

- Values of meta variables `title`, `author`, and `date` (if provided) will be transformed to the target output format before they are passed into templates.

- Fixed the bug that the default CSS was not added to HTML output.

- Removed dependency on the **mime** package.

- Added experimental support for HTML slides: `markdown::mark_html(..., meta = list(css = c('default', 'slides'), js = 'slides'))`. If you prefer knitting `Rmd` documents in RStudio, you may use the output format:

  ```yaml
  output:
    markdown::html_format:
      meta:
        css: [default, slides]
        js: [slides]
  ```

  See https://yihui.org/en/2023/01/minimal-r-markdown/ for a demo.

# CHANGES IN markdown VERSION 1.4

- Empty `\title{}` in LaTeX output will be removed (along with `\maketitle`).

- highlight.js is loaded from https://www.jsdelivr.com/package/gh/highlightjs/cdn-release by default now. This means more languages are supported (not only R), but also means syntax-highlighting will not work offline at the moment (it will be improved in future).

- MathJax failed to load in the previous version. The bug has been fixed now.

- Removed the function `markdownExtensions()`.

# CHANGES IN markdown VERSION 1.3

- Switched the underlying Markdown rendering engine from the C library **sundown** (which has been deprecated for a decade) to the R package **commonmark** (thanks, @jeroen, yihui/knitr#1329).

- The functions `renderMarkdown()` and `markdownToHTML()` have been renamed to `mark()` and `mark_html()`, respectively. The old names are still kept in this package for backward-compatibility.

- Removed the arguments `stylesheet` and `fragment.only` in `mark_html()`. For `stylesheet`, please use the argument `meta = list(css = ...)` to provide the CSS stylesheet. For `fragment.only`, please use `mark_html(template = FALSE)` or `mark_html(options = '-standalone')` instead of `fragment.only = TRUE`. Currently these old arguments are still accepted internally, but may be deprecated and dropped in the long run.

- The `file` argument of `mark()` and `mark_html()` can also take a character vector of Markdown text now.

- Removed functions `rendererExists()`, `rendererOutputType()`, and `registeredRenderer()`. They were primarily for internal use.

- Deprecated the function `markdownExtensions()`. All extensions should be specified via the `options` argument of functions like `mark()`, e.g., `mark(options = '+table+tasklist')`. See all options on the help page `?markdown::markdown_options`.

- Renamed `markdownHTMLOptions()` to `markdown_options()`.

# CHANGES IN markdown VERSION 1.2

- Fixed the warnings "a function declaration without a prototype is deprecated in all versions of C" (#94).

# CHANGES IN markdown VERSION 1.0

## MAJOR CHANGES

- The default value of the encoding argument of renderMarkdown() and markdownToHTML() has been changed from getOption("encoding") to "UTF-8". The encoding of the input file will always be assumed to be UTF-8.

- markdownToHTML() will return a character vector encoded in UTF-8 (instead of the system's native encoding) when not writing to an output file.

# CHANGES IN markdown VERSION 0.7

## BUG FIXES

- if both the 'file' and 'text' arguments are provided but file = NULL, e.g. markdownToHTML(file = NULL, text = ?), markdownToHTML() can throw an error indicating the file is invalid (thanks, Tyler Rinker, hadley/staticdocs#66)

- markdownToHTML(text = ?, output = ?) was broken (#54)

# CHANGES IN markdown VERSION 0.6.5

- the options markdown.HTML.stylesheet and markdown.HTML.header used in markdownToHTML() can be character vectors (they will be processed by paste(x, collapse = '\n')

## MAJOR CHANGES

- the 'text' argument in markdownToHTML() and renderMarkdown() is treated as lines of input now, i.e. if 'text' is provided, it is passed to the markdown renderer as paste(text, collapse = '\n'); in the previous versions, it was processed by paste(text, collapse = '')
